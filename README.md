This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

I wanted to experiment with using a Mono Repo for some of my personal projects that use the same frameworks. The `lib` folder contains resources shared across applications.

## Projects

### Spendly (expense-tracker)

https://spendly-app.vercel.app/

A web app for tracking personal expenses and spending, with strong catigorization features and charts for tracking spending over time.

**Note: I personally use this app, as well as some close friends and family. It is live for anyone to use, but if you are sensitive about your data, you do so at your own risk, as there are indoubtedly some security holes that I have not patched up, this being a side project.**

- NestJS (Backend)
- Auth0 (Auth)

### SetScore

One of my first projects I started building when I was still in school was a simple web page for my father's Tennis Doubles League to report their scores. That project has had many iterations, and the one in this repo is the latest version of that. 

This iteration is still a work in progress, and is not live at this time.
